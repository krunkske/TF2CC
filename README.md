# TF2 Community Casual
## A program designed to seamlessly connect players to vanilla-like community servers, serving as an alternative to Valve's Casual mode.
## Overview:
TF2 Community Casual offers a solution to the persistent issues within Valve's official Casual mode, which has been plauged by bots and cheaters for may years, making Casual completly unplayable. This program aims to replace Casual matchmaking as best as possible by searching trough verified community servers that closely mimic the vanilla TF2 gameplay.

### currently, the amount of Casual servers is very limited. If you own a TF2 server that focusses to be a Casual/vanilla experience, please open an Issue.

## Key Features:
- Automated Server Selection: The script scans through a curated list of verified community servers that aim to be as vanilla as possible and finds the best match for you and your friends.

- Auto Connect: Once a server has been found, it will automatically connect you to it or open TF2 in that server.

- Pre-made Configurations: Whether it's opting for Casual servers, servers with unique mods like Roll the Dice (RTD) or servers like Uncletopia, you choose what you want to play.

- (Future) Custom Configurations: Make and maintain your own set of liked servers or download one from the internet.

## Why TF2 Community Casual?
Valve's neglect of the Casual mode has led to widespread frustration among TF2 fans. Although community servers exist, pure vanilla servers can be difficult to find or just non-existent. TF2CC tries to bride this gap by automatically searching for the best match and connecting you to it.
