# TF2 Community Casual
## A Python script designed to seamlessly connect players to vanilla-like community servers, serving as an alternative to Valve's Casual mode.
## Overview:
TF2 Community Casual offers a solution to the persistent issues within Valve's official Casual mode, which has been plauged by bots and cheaters for may years, making Casual completly unplayable. This script aims to replace Casual matchmaking to some degree by searching trough verified community servers that closely mimic the vanilla TF2 gameplay experience.

### currently, the amount of verified Vanilla/Uncletopia servers is very limited. I will add more later on. The amount of Casual like servers out there is also very limited and we need more of them.

## Key Features:
- Automated Server Selection: The script scans through a curated list of verified community servers that aim to be as vanilla as possible and finds the best match for you and your friends.

- Customizable Configurations: Whether it's opting for servers with unique mods like Roll the Dice (RTD), servers like Uncletopia or 100 player servers, you choose what you want to play.

## Why TF2 Community Casual?
Valve's neglect of the Casual mode has led to widespread frustration among TF2 fans. Although community servers exist, pure vanilla servers can be difficult to find or just non-existent. TF2CC tries to bride this gap.
